# Fix My Code Challenge

Welcome to the Fix My Code Challenge, a series of coding challenges designed to test your understanding of programming concepts and software engineering best practices.

The challenges in this repository are intended to simulate real-world scenarios where you might be given a codebase to troubleshoot and debug. Each challenge consists of a broken codebase with a set of specific issues that need to be fixed.

```

This repository contains five directories, one for each challenge. Each challenge directory contains a broken codebase, a set of test cases to validate the code, and a README file with instructions on how to complete the challenge.

## Getting Started

To begin, select a challenge directory and follow the instructions in the README file to fix the codebase. For each challenge, you will be given a set of test cases to validate your solution. These test cases are located in the `tests` directory and can be run using Python's unittest framework.

To run the tests for a specific challenge, navigate to the challenge directory and run the following command:

```
python -m unittest discover -v
```

This will run all the tests in the `tests` directory and provide verbose output.
